A list of the objects that will be used to make up the compressor

======
1. Amplifier 

An amplifier object will apply volume and gain parameters to the signal. 
This is not treated as a gain parameter since any amount of modeling could be included within this stage. 
======
======
2. Level Detector (Signal Envelope Follower)

An object which calculates the current signal level. 
This is expanded on with the addition of attack and release parameters. 
This can also be expanded on with the addition of peak, rms and underdamping to emulate a VU meter. 
======
======
3. Gain Computer

Gain Computer object calculates the amount of gain required to apply to the output signal given the output from the level detector. 
there are a number of curves and smoothing techniques to apply when deciding the gain to apply. 
This computer is genberic enough to be expanded on to create a compressor, limiter or expanded (upwards or downwards), 
depending on the way the gain is computed.
