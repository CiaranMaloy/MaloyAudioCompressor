// 1. Make flow diagram of signal path
// 2. Make Mock up GUI 
3. Expand on how each component in the flow diagram is going to work as an object
    a. a compressor is not one object but a number of objects that work together, 
    these being: 
        i. Gain object (used multiple times throughout, as static gain and as a digitally controlled amplifier)
        ii. a Level detector, which computes the signal envelope using attack and release parameters
        iii. a Gain computer which works out how much gain should be applied to each sample in the current buffer given it's envelope
4. Update this information into the README.md file
