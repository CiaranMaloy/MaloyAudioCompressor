// 1. Make flow diagram of signal path
// 2. Make Mock up GUI 
3. Expand on how each component in the flow diagram is going to work as an object
    a. a compressor is not one object but a number of objects that work together, 
    these being: 
        // i. Gain object (used multiple times throughout, as static gain and as a digitally controlled amplifier)
        // ii. a Level detector, which computes the signal envelope using attack and release parameters
        // iii. a Gain computer which works out how much gain should be applied to each sample in the current buffer given it's envelope
TODO: 4. Update this information into the README.md file

2022/12/17

// 1. Amplifier object is made
// 2. Make LevelDetector object in some basic form
// 3. Make a GainComputer object
All three objects have been made in their basic form, so next update is to make work in some audio effect
